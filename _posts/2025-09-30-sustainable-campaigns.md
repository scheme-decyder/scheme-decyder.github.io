How many times have you started a new Mordheim campaign, been excited for the long campaign and watching your characters level up, only for the campaign to die after two sessions. I've had this happen many times. I wanted to run a Stargrave Campaign, I didn't want it to die, but I also didn't have a huge amount of time to dedicate to managing it. I wanted the campaign to run with little input from me. I was willing to put in up front effort to get the campaign running, but I wanted the ongoing effort to be minimal. This involved putting as much responsibility onto the players as I could.

Players would be responsible for:
* Scheduling games
* Playing games in their own house

I supplied the terrain. Everyone already had painted models. Getting everyone painted terrian.

The core concept is that I will post fixtures at the start of the month and everyone will have a month to organise, play and post results. 1 game per month, 5 games and some sort of finale all in game at the end. Everyone has access to a table except for one player so he will always be playing 'away' games

Taking lessons from running RPG's.
* Get reliable people
* Fixed length
* Regular sessions
* Reward the things you want to see

League points - rewarding what you want to see
